## üöÄ Overview
GlucoSweet is a beautifully designed macOS app made to help people monitor and understand their blood glucose levels. Instead of manually logging readings across different devices or notebooks, GlucoSweet provides a unified dashboard, historical trends, and predictive insights ‚Äî all with an elegant and clean interface.  

It supports importing readings from devices or manual entries, visualizing glucose variation over time, and highlighting patterns like morning spikes, post-meal drops, or overnight fluctuations. Whether you're managing diabetes, optimizing your diet, or just tracking overall health, GlucoSweet makes your data actionable.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About (Deep Dive)
Glucose data by itself is just numbers ‚Äî GlucoSweet transforms them into meaningful feedback:

- **Data Import & Sync**  
  Pull in data from BG meters, health platforms, or enter readings manually.  

- **Trend Analytics**  
  Day/night cycles, weekly patterns, time-in-range metrics.  

- **Alerts & Notifications**  
  Custom reminders to measure, trend alerts when glucose remains too high or too low.  

- **Graphical Visualizations**  
  Line charts, heatmaps, distribution curves to see where most of your readings lie.  

- **Customizable Targets**  
  Set personal target ranges, see deviations, and adjust over time.

---

## üîß Features
- Manual entry + import via Health/compatible devices.  
- Time-in-range (TIR) display (e.g., % of readings in target/above/below).  
- Post-meal, fasting, bedtime, and overnight glucose trend analysis.  
- Visual charts: line graphs, scatter plots, distribution histograms.  
- Reminders for measuring or logging readings.  
- Data export (CSV / PDF) for sharing with doctors or dietitians.  
- Dark mode / light mode themes.  
- Units toggle (mg/dL ‚Üî mmol/L).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases
- **People with diabetes** seeking better control and insight.  
- **Nutrition / diet tracking** (observing how meals affect glucose).  
- **Fitness enthusiasts** optimizing performance and recovery.  
- **Sleep researchers** examining overnight glucose stability.  
- **Health professionals** reviewing patient glucose reports easily.

## üß≠ Workflow Example
1. Open GlucoSweet ‚Üí connect/import from your glucose meter or Health app.  
2. Enter readings manually if needed.  
3. Review your dashboard: see trends over the past day, week, month.  
4. Set or adjust target ranges.  
5. Enable alerts for high/low glucose events.  
6. Export data before medical appointments or share with caregivers.

---

## üìö Technical Background
GlucoSweet uses validated statistical methods and clinically relevant metrics:

- Time-in-range, standard deviation, coefficient of variation.  
- Moving average smoothing for trend clarity.  
- Outlier detection to flag erroneous readings.  
- Compatible with standard glucose units and conversion.  

Data security and privacy are built-in: everything stored locally (unless user opts in), with optional export only under user control.

---

## üéì Educational Value
For those learning about glucose metabolism:

- Visual tools help understand the effects of meals, sleep, exercise.  
- Helps caregivers, patients, dietitians communicate about glucose patterns.  
- Good for teaching basics of glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and variability.
